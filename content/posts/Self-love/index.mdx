It's a funny thing about life:

If you refuse to accept anything less than the best, you very often get it.


If you don’t love yourself you’ll have no sense of self-worth, and no feeling of
acceptance or belonging.

Some people think it’s a sin to love yourself. They consider those who love them-
selves to be selfish, conceited and rather unpleasant.

But they’re mistaken. 

They confuse self-love with false pride and narcissism (being in love with yourself)
which is quite a different matter.

Vanity and arrogance are usually a form of
bravado engaged in by people who love themselves too little and are trying to
cover it up.

The belief that you need to be different from how you are in order to be loved
causes a great deal of misery.

Unless you are happy within, you’ll never be truly
satisfied with what you do.

Loving yourself unconditionally is the key to happiness.

But you don’t have to be perfect: the most loved person in the world makes
mistakes!

You don’t even have to do your best. You don’t have to prove anything.

You’re all right because you’re all right, and lovable exactly as you are.
