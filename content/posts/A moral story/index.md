On a certain day, a bull and a pheasant were grazing on a field.

The bull was grazing and the pheasant was picking ticks off the bull—a perfect partnership. Looking at the huge tree at the edge of the field, the pheasant said, “Alas, there was a time I could fly to the topmost branch
of the tree.

Now I do not have enough strength in my wing to even get to the first branch.”
The bull said nonchalantly, “Just eat a little bit of my dung every day, and watch what
happens. Within two weeks, you’ll get to the top.”

The pheasant said, “Oh come on, that’s rubbish. What kind of nonsense is that?”
The bull said, “Try it and see. The whole of humanity is onto it.”

Very hesitantly, the pheasant started pecking. And lo, on the very first day, he reached the
first branch. Within a fortnight, he had reached the topmost branch. He sat there, just
beginning to enjoy the scenery.

The old farmer, rocking on his rocking chair, saw a fat old pheasant on top of the tree. He
pulled out his shotgun and shot the bird off the tree.

**Moral of the story:**  *Bullshit may get you to the top, but it never lets you stay there!*
